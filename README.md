## Setting Up the `.env` File

Before running the project, you need to set up the `.env` file with the necessary environment variables.

1. In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env`.
2. Inside the `.env` file, add the following line:

   ```env
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   #LINKEDIN 
   EMAIL
   PASSWORD
